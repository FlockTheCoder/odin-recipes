    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This really awesome cake is vegan and glutenfree, and there is no sugar added. Its flour is made of bananas, oats & applesauce with a bit of of cashew butter.</p>

    <p>The recipe is based on the <a href="https://www.medicalmedium.com/blog/wild-blueberry-banana-bread" alt=" Blueberry Banana Bread by Anthony William - The Medical Medium">Blueberry Banana Bread</a> by Anthony William.</p>

    <p>I stripped it off any added sugar, added other fruit sources and adjusted the other ingredients until it was perfect. That is how I like it best - give it a try!</p>

        <li>400g ripe banans</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons backing soda</li>
